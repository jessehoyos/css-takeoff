Basic directory structure and base files to get a project started. Based of my needs, made up of some best practices and neat tricks picked up along the way.

### Structure
```

|   |-- _mixins.styl     # commonly used and helpful mixins
|   |-- _typography.styl # https://github.com/devinhunt/typebase.css
