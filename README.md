Basic directory structure and base files to get a project started. Based of my needs, made up of some best practices and neat tricks picked up along the way.

### Structure
```
css-takeoff/

|   |-- _variables.styl  # system font stack, breakpoints and blocks
|   |-- _mixins.styl     # commonly used and helpful mixins
|   `-- _base.styl       # box-sizing
|
|-- modules/
|   ...
|
|-- pages/
